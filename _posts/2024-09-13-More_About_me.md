This website will primarily focus on my professional and academic development, so you likely won’t find posts on topics like politics, philosophy, religion, music, or personal anecdotes. However, to add a more personal touch, here are a few of my favorite books on topics I do enjoy—though, these days, finding time to read them is a luxury:

[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives by Zbigniew Brzezinski](https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/36/36669B7894E857AC4F3445EA646BFFE1_Zbigniew_Brzezinski_-_The_Grand_ChessBoard.doc.pdf)
A timeless read and probably my favorite book on geopolitics.

The Rebel by Albert Camus
This book continues to haunt me. I’ve re-read some chapters dozens of times, while others remain a mystery. I often find myself returning to it, trying to grasp more.

Letters to a Young Contrarian and Mortality by Christopher Hitchens
Two profound works by one of my intellectual heroes.

Groucho and Me by Groucho Marx
One of my favorite people to ever live. I remember reading this on the subway to class and always ending up laughing out loud.

Antología comentada de la poesía lírica española by Miguel Díez
I’m not a poetry enthusiast by any means, but I received this book in high school. Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate it and now find myself revisiting its pages from time to time.

The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson
Hands down the best fantasy series ever written. I’m a huge nerd when it comes to anything related to the Cosmere universe.
