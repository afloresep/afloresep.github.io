## Hardware

### **PC**

**Home**:

I picked up an old, second-hand PC for around $100 to handle basic tasks and to connect remotely to my more powerful work setup when I need extra computational power.

**Work:**

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 (AM5)
GPU: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4070 Ti
Storage: 2 TB Samsung 990 Pro SSD + 1 TB WD Black SN770 SSD + 10 TB Seagate Pro HDD
RAM: 64 GB (2x32 GB) Kingston FURY Beast DDR5 (6000 MHz)
Motherboard: ASUS TUF GAMING B650-PLUS WIFI
Case: NZXT H9 Flow
PSU: be quiet! Pure Power 12 M 850W
Cooling: Arctic Liquid Freezer III - 360

### **Mice**

**Home**:

Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED – Great value for gaming, responsive and reliable. However, the loud clicks make it less ideal for an office environment.

**Work**:

Logitech MX Master 3S – I’m blown away by this mouse. I’d seen it recommended by many tech reviewers but didn’t expect it to be this good. The ergonomics, programmable buttons, and infinite scroll are game-changers. Highly recommended.

### **Screen**

**_Home_**: 

LG 27UP85NP-W (3840 x 2160 Pixels, 60Hz, 27"). I really like this screen. I've tried 27" 1440p 120Hz in the past but I'd say that for the same price I'd rather lose the hertzs and move to 4k. Really creespy text. Less eye fatigue. Also 27" is the way to go for me. 

**_Work_:**

SAMSUNG Odyssey G9 LS49CG950EU - Gaming Monitor, 49 ", DQHD, 240 Hz. This thing is just absurd. Massive size at 240HZ and DQHD resolution. At first I didn't enjoy it because I had to move the head to much to look at the edges of the screen but after a few weeks of getting used to it I have to say its awesome. 

### **Keyboard**

**_Home_ & _Work_:** 

I use the _Logitech MX Keys S 100%_. I love this thing. It’s comfortable, quiet, and has great shortcut keys. I love the multi-device pairing feature since I take it between work and home. The only downside is that it’s a membrane keyboard; I miss the tactile feel of my old mechanical keyboard. I plan on building my own custom keyboard again and make it _thock_ but these are usually very expensive.  

### **Laptop**

**Home:**
I don’t have a laptop yet, but I’m eyeing a MacBook Pro M4. I’m debating whether the M4 Pro version is worth it, considering my main workload will be handled by my desktop. The MacBook Air is tempting too, but the lack of ports and the fanless design are deal-breakers for me.

### **Chair**

**_Home_:**
Songmics Office. Truly horrendous chair. I will definetively change it. 

**_Work_:**
No idea what the model is, but it’s old and surprisingly the most comfortable chair I’ve ever used.

## Software

- OS: **Linux Mint** – Reliable and efficient. I love you Linux.
- Window Manager: **i3** – Perfect for productivity. The keyboard-driven workflow makes everything faster. I feel lost when using a traditional desktop environment now.
- Text Editor: **Vim** – I’m still learning, but it’s already speeding up my coding. I’ve started instinctively using Vim shortcuts (mod+) even in regular text editors. I feel like this is a rabbit whole that I will not get out of. 
- Note-taking: **Obsidian** – A fantastic tool for note-taking. It’s lightweight, supports Markdown, and has great features like internal linking and extensions for math and graphs. I've been using it for years. I won't change to nothing else. Way better than Notion if you ask me...
- GPTs: **ChatGPT** – Mostly used for grammar checks or generating LaTeX for complex math. I try not to rely on it for coding as I prefer solving problems on my own, but it’s helpful for advice in areas where I lack expertise

## Books
This website will primarily focus on my professional and academic development, so you likely won’t find posts on topics like politics, philosophy, religion, music, or personal anecdotes. However, to add a more personal touch, here are a few of my favorite books on topics I do enjoy—though, these days, finding time to read them is a luxury:

[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives by Zbigniew Brzezinski](https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/36/36669B7894E857AC4F3445EA646BFFE1_Zbigniew_Brzezinski_-_The_Grand_ChessBoard.doc.pdf)
A timeless read and probably my favorite book on geopolitics.

The Rebel by Albert Camus
This book continues to haunt me. I’ve re-read some chapters dozens of times, while others remain a mystery. I often find myself returning to it, trying to grasp more.

Groucho and Me by Groucho Marx
One of my favorite people to ever live. I remember reading this on the subway to class and always ending up laughing out loud.

Antología comentada de la poesía lírica española by Miguel Díez
I’m not a poetry enthusiast by any means, but I received this book in high school. Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate it and now find myself revisiting its pages from time to time.

The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson
Hands down the best fantasy series ever written. I’m a huge nerd when it comes to anything related to the Cosmere universe.
