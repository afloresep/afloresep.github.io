## Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

In this project, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. The model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.

### Project Overview

- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Model Architecture**: Custom CNN with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers
- **Training**: 50 epochs using Adam optimizer

### Key Learnings

1. Importance of data augmentation in improving model generalization
2. Impact of learning rate scheduling on training stability
3. Techniques for visualizing and interpreting CNN features

### Future Work

- Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet
- Explore more advanced architectures like Inception or DenseNet
- Apply the model to a real-world image classification task
