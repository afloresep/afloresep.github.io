**Someone once told me that in order to think, you have to write. So here’s my attempt.**

### Coursework
This section tracks the classes I’m currently taking or have completed, both through formal University courses and self-study. I’ll create subpages for individual courses or topics.

- **[HS2023-0: Machine Learning](https://www.cvg.unibe.ch/teaching/course/1)**  
  According to the course description, this class covers fundamental topics in machine learning and pattern recognition. It provides an introduction to:
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning
  
  These topics are explored through a probabilistic framework, with a strong emphasis on optimization techniques throughout the course.  
  
  **Note:** All material posted here reflects my own work and thoughts. Naturally, I won’t share any restricted resources or information meant solely for enrolled students.

### Portfolio
This section will document any projects I undertake during my PhD or on my own. It serves two main purposes:
1. To showcase my skills and past experiences to others.
2. To maintain a personal record or diary of everything I’ve done, allowing me to reflect on my progress, mistakes, and reasoning. Plus, I simply enjoy taking notes, so there’s that too.

### Blog Posts
Here, I’ll store subpages with additional insights, updates, or thoughts related to the coursework or projects from my portfolio.

### Additional Info
This website will primarily focus on my professional and academic development, so you likely won’t find posts on topics like politics, philosophy, religion, music, or personal anecdotes. However, to add a more personal touch, here are a few of my favorite books on topics I do enjoy—though, these days, finding time to read them is a luxury:

- **The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives** by Zbigniew Brzezinski  
  A timeless read and probably my favorite book on geopolitics.  
  [CIA PDF Link](https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/36/36669B7894E857AC4F3445EA646BFFE1_Zbigniew_Brzezinski_-_The_Grand_ChessBoard.doc.pdf)
  
- **The Rebel** by Albert Camus  
  This book continues to haunt me. I’ve re-read some chapters dozens of times, while others remain a mystery. I often find myself returning to it, trying to grasp more.

- **Letters to a Young Contrarian** and **Mortality** by Christopher Hitchens  
  Two profound works by one of my intellectual heroes.

- **Groucho and Me** by Groucho Marx  
  One of my favorite people to ever live. I remember reading this on the subway to class and always ending up laughing out loud.

- **Antología comentada de la poesía lírica española** by Miguel Díez  
  I’m not a poetry enthusiast by any means, but I received this book in high school. Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate it and now find myself revisiting its pages from time to time.

 Here’s an improved version of your sentence:

- **The Stormlight Archive** by Brandon Sanderson  
  Hands down the best fantasy series ever written. I'm a huge nerd when it comes to anything related to the Cosmere universe.
