PhD in Chemoinformatics at the University of Bern, working with Reymond's group. My research focuses on Big Data and AI. Trying to advance the field of chemistry and computer-aided drug discovery. I am particularly interested in employing machine learning and deep learning techniques to address complex problems in these areas. My work involves using tools like [TMAP](https://afloresep.github.io/TMAP/)

In addition to my primary research, I am also exploring algorithms, data structures, and computer vision, aiming to expand my skill set and apply these concepts to various challenges in my field. This site serves as a platform to document my coursework, projects, and reflections as I navigate my academic and professional journey

Also, Someone once told me that in order to think, you have to write. So here’s my attempt.

### Coursework
This section tracks the classes I’m currently taking or have completed, both through formal University courses and self-study. I’ll create subpages for individual courses or topics.

- **[HS2023-0: Machine Learning](https://www.cvg.unibe.ch/teaching/course/1)**  
  According to the course description, this class covers fundamental topics in machine learning and pattern recognition. It provides an introduction to:
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning
  
  These topics are explored through a probabilistic framework, with a strong emphasis on optimization techniques throughout the course.  
  
  **Note:** All material posted here reflects my own work and thoughts. Naturally, I won’t share any restricted resources or information meant solely for enrolled students.

### Portfolio
This section will document any projects I undertake during my PhD or on my own. It serves two main purposes:
1. To showcase my skills and past experiences to others.
2. To maintain a personal record or diary of everything I’ve done, allowing me to reflect on my progress, mistakes, and reasoning. Plus, I simply enjoy taking notes, so there’s that too.

### Blog Posts
Here, I’ll store subpages with additional insights, updates, or thoughts related to the coursework or projects from my portfolio.
