Here you'll find my notes on various courses, articles related to machine learning, artificial intelligence in computer vision etc.Pretty much anything worth studying. 


## TMAP
Some, if not most, of my works so far during the PhD revolves around TMAP. So, of course, I have dedicated some time to understand the concepts behind it along with the code. I have dedicated a special blog post to TMAP and some of the key aspects that involves including LSH and Min-Hashing. 
1. [TMAP](https://afloresep.github.io/TMAP/):
Here you can find pretty much a basic introduction to what TMAP is. Also includes links to other concepts discussed within the post.
    - [MinHashing](https://afloresep.github.io/posts/2024/09/MinHashing/)
    - [LSH Forest](https://afloresep.github.io/posts/2024/09/LSH-Forest/)
    - [K-NN Graph](https://afloresep.github.io/posts/2024/09/knn-graph/)
And soon I will be adding others. 

## Computer Vision
All the posts about Computer Vision. Including my notes on the course HS2024-Computer Vision from Universit√§t Bern. This course covers fundamental topics in computer vision, providing an introduction to image formation, image processing, feature detection, segmentation, multiple view geometry and 3D reconstruction, motion, object recognition and classification.
1. [Projection Models](https://afloresep.github.io/computer-vision/Projection-Models/): 
This post provides a detailed breakdown of camera and projection concepts, focusing on how 3D objects are projected into 2D images.

## Machine Learning
Soon to be added.

## Applied Optimization
Soon to be added.
